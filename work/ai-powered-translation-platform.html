      <h1>AI-powered translation platform</h1>
      <h4>2024</h4>
      <p>Pharmaceutical ∙ Artificial Intelligence</p>
    
      <section>
        <h5>Summary</h5>
        <p>
          As a UX consultant, I led the design and research for a translation platform created to streamline
          the translation of regulatory pharmaceutical content across 27 European languages.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was responsible for service design, UX/UI design, and user research, working closely with
          stakeholders to deliver an interface that addressed key user pain points. The MVP enabled users
          to translate 2,000-word documents in under three minutes and achieved a baseline usability
          score of <strong>81.7%</strong>.

        <h5>Challenge</h5>
        <p>
          The client needed to translate regulatory materials into local languages for every market they
          operated in. The process at the time was slow, manual, and required multiple layers of review
          and approval. Progress tracking was difficult, and translators spent excessive time on
          administrative tasks.
        </p>
        <blockquote>The core issue was too much manual work and too little visibility.</blockquote>
        <h6>Goal</h6>
        <p>
          Use AI to streamline translation and introduce a centralised platform to
          manage the entire translation lifecycle. Success would reduce cost, improve delivery speed,
          and increase capacity to manage multiple product launches in parallel.
        </p>
      </section>
    
      <section>
        <h5>Research &amp; discovery</h5>
        <p>
          The project began with both quantitative and qualitative research to understand how translations
          were being managed across regions.
        </p>
    
        <h6>Quantitative research</h6>
        <p>
          A 17-question survey was launched across markets to identify workflow patterns, bottlenecks,
          and reliance on third-party tools.
        </p>
    
        <h6>Qualitative research</h6>
        <p>
          Five two-hour focus group sessions were held with translation and regulatory teams across
          Europe. Using a future-state process map, participants were guided through early tool concepts
          to gather in-depth feedback.
        </p>
      </section>
    
      <section>
        <h5>Key findings</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Lack of visibility across projects</li>
          <li>Frequent rework and limited version control</li>
          <li>Too many people involved in repetitive tasks</li>
          <li>Missed deadlines due to inefficiencies</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h5>Personas</h5>
        <p>Two primary user groups were identified:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Local users</strong> – responsible for translating content into their native language</li>
          <li><strong>Global users</strong> – overseeing multilingual projects without directly performing translations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Empathy maps helped explore what these users think, feel, and struggle with. This reinforced the
          need for a centralised, intuitive tool offering transparency and accountability.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h5>Ideation &amp; design</h5>
        <p>
          To identify effective design patterns, I reviewed workflow management tools such as Jira,
          Asana, and Monday.com.
        </p>
    
        <h6>Information architecture</h6>
        <p>
          An Object Map was developed to visualise relationships between projects, users, and sentence-level
          translations — crucial in a context where precision is essential.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h5>Wireframes &amp; prototypes</h5>
        <p>
          Initial sketches evolved into mid-fidelity wireframes and later into interactive prototypes in
          Figma. These allowed testing of how Global users would monitor project progress while Local
          users focused on detailed translation tasks.
        </p>
    
        <h6>UI design</h6>
        <p>
          I built on the organisation’s internal design system for consistency, adding custom components
          as needed. Accessibility was validated using tools such as Stark.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h5>Testing &amp; validation</h5>
        <p>
          Remote moderated usability testing was conducted with 18 users across 16 European countries,
          representing both user types.
        </p>
    
        <h6>Test tasks</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>Approving AI-generated translations</li>
          <li>Interpreting project statuses</li>
          <li>Navigating reviewer feedback</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h6>Key findings</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>Many users ignored AI translation metrics — improved terminology and preview features were required</li>
          <li>Workflow interactions scored 4.25 / 5 for usability</li>
          <li>Local users found cross-market views confusing and preferred role-specific dashboards</li>
          <li>Users valued integration with external tools and suggested deep linking to third-party systems</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
    
      <section>
        <h5>Final product &amp; impact</h5>
        <p>The final design included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A dashboard to track translation progress</li>
          <li>Role-specific user views</li>
          <li>Clear task indicators and progress states</li>
          <li>Comment threads and audit trails for compliance</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h6>Outcomes</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>Average translation time reduced to under 3 minutes per document</li>
          <li>27 languages supported at MVP</li>
          <li>13 prioritised recommendations delivered for future improvement</li>
          <li>Baseline usability score: 81.7%</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h6>User feedback</h6>
        <blockquote>
          The system is very user-friendly — I thought it might be confusing at, but it was actually
          very easy to use! I’d like to see an ‘action required’ label so it’s clear when there’s something
          for me to do.

        <h5>Lessons learned</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Digital literacy varied widely, and some users resisted new workflows out of familiarity with old processes.
          </li>
          <li>Usability testing was invaluable for challenging stakeholder assumptions.</li>
          <li>After around five participants, new insights began to plateau.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          A key challenge was persuading stakeholders to deprioritise non-essential features. Real user
          evidence made it easier to advocate for simpler, more focused design decisions.
        </p>
      </section>
    
      <section>
        <h5>Future steps</h5>
        <p>
          While the iteration was successful, there is room for continued improvement. Recommendations
          include refined role filtering, clearer task ownership indicators, and better terminology for
          translation metrics.
        </p>
        <p>
          The long-term vision is a scalable, AI-powered translation system that significantly reduces
          time-to-market for regulated content.

        <h5>Conclusion</h5>
        <p>
          This project allowed me to combine service design, user research, and interface design in a
          highly specialised context. It was deeply rewarding to design a product that not only met user
          needs but also supported an essential global process in the pharmaceutical industry.

          wireframes, personas, or design recommendations from the project.
