      <h1>Designing data clarity for renewable risk management</h1>
      <h4>2023</h4>
      <p>Renewable Energy ∙ Data Visualisation</p>
    
      <section>
        <h5>Summary</h5>
        <p>
          In 2023, I partnered with a renewable energy organisation to redesign their risk management
          process for distributed renewable energy assets. The goal was to create a unified platform
          called a risk management platform that would streamline workflows, eliminate fragmentation,
          and elevate how data was visualised, interpreted, and acted upon across the organisation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The platform has since replaced five legacy tools and is now used across 350+ global renewable
          energy sites, empowering teams to make faster, more informed decisions through well-designed,
          actionable data visualisation.

        <h5>Challenge</h5>
        <h6>From data overload to insight</h6>
        <p>
          The client manages cloud-based control of renewable energy assets like wind and solar farms,
          using AI to balance supply and demand. However, their internal risk processes hadn’t caught up:
          data was scattered, visuals were inconsistent, and decision-makers had no clear window into
          overall risk.
        </p>
    
        <h6>Key challenges</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>Asset Managers wasting hours navigating siloed tools and spreadsheets</li>
          <li>No standardised risk taxonomy or consistent visual reporting</li>
          <li>Slow, manual reporting processes prone to inconsistency</li>
          <li>Inability to surface key insights quickly or intuitively</li>
        </ul>

      <blockquote>
        The business imperative was clear: consolidate risk-related data into a single platform with
        intelligent visualisation and seamless workflows.
      </blockquote>
    
        <h5>Discovery &amp; research</h5>
        <p>
          The client provided a foundation of usage data, which I analysed to identify usage patterns and
          drop-off points. To contextualise the numbers, I led qualitative research including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>1:1 stakeholder interviews</li>
          <li>Card sorting to align on terminology</li>
          <li>A gap analysis of all five existing tools</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>
          Persona development was data-driven, resulting in four key user groups with distinct needs
          around data consumption and reporting:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Directors needed high-level dashboards with exportable reports</li>
          <li>Asset Managers required visual alerts, trends, and drill-down views</li>
          <li>Operations Managers looked for visibility across sites and users</li>
          <li>Field Operatives needed mobile-friendly forms with minimal visual clutter</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>
          One critical insight emerged: users weren’t lacking data—they lacked context and clarity. They
          didn’t just need to track incidents; they needed the right information, surfaced at the right
          time through effective visual cues.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h5>Designing visual intelligence</h5>
        <p>
          Our ideation focused on turning complex risk data into intuitive visual stories. In co-creation
          workshops with stakeholders, we explored dashboard concepts that surfaced patterns, anomalies,
          and priorities without overwhelming the user.
        </p>
    
        <h6>Key design goals</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>Establish a unified visual hierarchy to reduce cognitive load</li>
          <li>Use colour, icons, and layout to flag severity and urgency</li>
          <li>Enable drill-downs from summary views to raw data</li>
          <li>Ensure reports were exportable and presentation-ready</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
    
      <section>
        <h5>From sketch to system</h5>
        <p>
          We moved from rapid sketching to mid- and high-fidelity prototypes. I contributed new components
          to the organisation’s design system to support data-heavy layouts, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Risk heatmaps with interactive filters</li>
          <li>Timeline views for incidents and resolutions</li>
          <li>Severity badges and dynamic labels</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I also applied accessibility standards (GDS, WCAG 2.1) to all visual elements, using tools to
          ensure charts, colours, and UI states were inclusive.
        </p>
      </section>
    
      <section>
        <h5>Usability testing &amp; visual feedback</h5>
        <p>
          We tested the prototype with representatives from each persona, focusing heavily on how users
          interpreted and interacted with visual data. Testing sessions included tasks such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Creating and assessing a risk using severity indicators</li>
          <li>Interpreting dashboard metrics and trend graphs</li>
          <li>Generating downloadable reports with visual summaries</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h6>Key findings included:</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Visual priority matters: Users expected critical risks to appear more prominently than they did.
            We revised the layout to support “at-a-glance” decisions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Familiarity bias: Some users initially resisted the dashboard format, preferring old spreadsheet
            views. But visualisation won over once they experienced faster insight.
          </li>
          <li>
            Validation helps: Visual feedback (e.g. risk severity sliders, form progress indicators)
            improved user confidence during complex inputs.
          </li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>
          We applied findings into a new version, focusing on clarity, consistency, and faster interpretation.
          Post-test surveys showed a 40% improvement in perceived task speed and confidence.

        <h5>Launch outcomes</h5>
        <p>
          The first MVP launched with Asset Managers as the primary focus. Over time, new features and roles
          were added, and the tool was adopted by hundreds of sites globally.
        </p>
        <p>The platform helped users:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Save time by reducing data entry and duplicate reporting</li>
          <li>Respond to incidents faster, thanks to clear prioritisation cues</li>
          <li>Gain a shared understanding of risk through standardised visual dashboards</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>
          The platform continues to evolve, with an average of two new features released per month — many
          related to data insight and automation.
        </p>
      </section>
    
      <section>
        <h5>Reflections</h5>
        <p>
          This project reinforced how vital it is to move beyond raw data and toward decision-ready design.
          Great visualisation isn’t decoration — it’s function. Especially in energy, where decisions carry
          operational and financial risk, clarity is critical.
        </p>
    
        <h6>Top lessons</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Invest early in defining visual language: icons, severity levels, and layout consistency helped
            unify how different teams understood risk.
          </li>
          <li>
            Simplicity scales: starting with a focused MVP for Asset Managers made it easier to expand to
            other personas without bloating the interface.
          </li>
          <li>
            Feedback loops matter: rapid testing cycles allowed users to co-own the visual logic, leading to
            higher trust in the tool.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
    
      <section>
        <h5>Future opportunities</h5>
        <p>
          The next frontier is AI-assisted visualisation. With advancements in LLMs and predictive analytics,
          there’s an opportunity to surface emerging risks before they appear in the data — through proactive,
          explainable visuals.
        </p>
        <p>Examples include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Generative summaries of risk clusters</li>
          <li>Visual forecasting of incident trends</li>
          <li>Natural language queries for on-demand reports</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>
          As the organisation continues this journey, the platform is well positioned as a scalable product
          where visual design meets operational intelligence.
        </p>
      </section>

        <h5>Final thoughts</h5>
        <p>
          Designing the platform was a rich, rewarding challenge. The client brought a thoughtful,
          collaborative mindset that allowed our team to deliver lasting impact. For me, the project highlighted
          the power of UX to make data visible, actionable, and empowering — especially in mission-critical,
          data-dense industries like renewable energy.
